            <p>Going green is easier than you think. There are little things you can do every day to help reduce greenhouse gases and
            make a less harmful impact on the environment. Taking care of the Earth is not just a responsibility -- it's a
            privilege. ­In that spirit, WE came up with 10 things you can do to help save the Earth.
            Are you concerned about the welfare of the earth? Do you want to do what you can to save it? With bad news about global
            warming, dying oceans, and endangered animals flooding us on a daily basis, it's hard to know where to start. It may
            seem like the actions of one person won't make a difference, but there are actually many ways you can help. Here are
            some suggestions for changing your personal habits and educating others to make a fruitful impact.
            I’ll bet you’ll learn something from this list that will help you be an even better steward of our air, water, land,
            and wildlife. Take a look and see if you are doing everything YOU can to <em>reduce, reuse, and recycle:</em></p>
            
            <h2>Pay attention to how you use water</h2>
            <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQuTMzriCxx4WF6DbNF0rm_9H6K455PzrENJ-m0Kl2BIksdYSIN" alt="save the water" style="width:200px; height:200px;" />
            <p>The little things can make a big difference. Every time you turn off the water
            while you're brushing your teeth, you're doing something good. Got a leaky toilet? You might be wasting 200 gallons
            (757 liters) of water a day<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/signpost/cc.html">[source: EPA]</a> . Try drinking tap water instead of bottled water, so you aren't wasting all
            that packaging as well. Wash your clothes in cold water when you can.By paying attention to how and when you use water, you can cut down on unnecessary water waste. Water conservation is
            cost-effective, and it also helps to reduce our demand for water. Taking simple steps to restrict unnecessary water use
            and improve efficiency can keep supply levels stable in your local area and around the world.</p>
            
            <h2>Walk or ride your bike to work, school and anywhere you can</h2>
            <img src="https://previews.123rf.com/images/chaliya/chaliya1509/chaliya150900077/45660811-ecology-bicycle-save-the-earth-concept-vector-illustration-.jpg" alt="using bike" style="width:200px; height:200px;"/>
            <p>You can reduce greenhouse gases while burning some calories and improving your health. If you can't walk or bike, use
            mass transit or carpool. Every car not on the road makes a difference.Riding a bicycle is a great way to contribute to the preservation of our eco system and environment here on our great
            planet earth. Many people are concerned with pollution and many other things that damage and dissolve the ozone and
            cause the atmosphere to be dirty. If we all contributed with one small thing that we can change in our daily living
            routines to help with the protection of the earth, perhaps we could, as a collective, make a substantial impact for the
            better.</p>

            <h2>Recycle</h2>
            <img src="https://www.kent.ac.uk/estates/images/recycle.jpg" alt="recyle" style="width:200px; height:200px;"  />
            <p>You can help reduce pollution just by putting that soda can in a different bin. If you're trying to choose between two
            products, pick the one with the least packaging. If an office building of 7,000 workers recycled all of its office
            paper waste for a year, it would be the equivalent of taking almost 400 cars off the road <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/signpost/cc.html">[source: EPA]</a>.</p>
